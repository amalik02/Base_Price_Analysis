The goal is to conduct a base pricing analysis. I will estimate brand-level demand using scanner data, and then make profitability predictions corresponding to specific base price changes. I will estimate log-linear demand models that use (log) prices and promotions as inputs, and predict log quantities, `log(1+Q)`. The models predict the demand for a focal brand, and I control for (log) prices and promotions of three competitors. This approach generalizes to an arbitrarily large number of competing products as long as the sample size is large enough.
